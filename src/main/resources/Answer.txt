- Is there a difference between $("h1 div"); and $("h1").$("div")? Could you give an example?
Yes, there's the difference.
$("h1 div"); - search any $("h1"), which has child element $("div")
$("h1").$("div"); - search a first $("h1"), and after search child $("div") in it.

Example:
<h1>
<h1>
    <div>
    </div>

$("h1 div"); - return error, because the first $("h1") hasn't child $("div")
$("h1 div"); - don't return error, because the second $("h1") has child $("div")
